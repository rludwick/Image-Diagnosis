# Image-Diagnosis
Detecting thoracic (i.e. chest) abnormalities via convolutional neural networks has recently been of piquing interest to the computer vision community. Our project seeks to build upon related work done already with AlexNet, by contributing 14 binary classifiers which can individually discern the most common chest issues diagnosed via X-ray imaging. Furthermore, we attempt an all-in-one multi-class classifier model from scratch and eventually via transfer learning with the first 10 layers of Inception V3 frozen. We utilize a dataset set of roughly 18,000 radiologist-labeled DICOM images to evaluate our models.
